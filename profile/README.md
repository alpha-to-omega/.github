Join developers around the world to create a multi-project.
I (mteam88) am working on inviting developers with different skills to come together and create something for the good of humanity.

### What projects?
Every greek letter from alpha to omega will have it's own unique repository with a project.
For a project to be accepted, it must satisfy the following
* No hate. None.
* Must benefit humanity. (get creative, this isn't a requirement to stress about)
* Must use an available greek letter.

### How does it work?
* Any developer can opt to create a project.
* After coordinating with me (mteam88,) they will be added to the organization and I will create a repo for their greek letter.
* They will have full access to that repo and be able to code their project.

### Okay! How can I help?
* Create a project... like duh
